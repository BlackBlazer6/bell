# Countdown.zone Privacy Statement
_Effective: March 15, 2018_

We are committed to protecting user privacy. For this reason, we have developed our own analytics mechanism to provide us with enough information to continue to improve the service while proudly keeping third party trackers off of the website. 

Even though the information we collect on [countdown.zone](https://countdown.zone) does not on its own allow us to identify specific individuals, we provide this privacy statement in order to be as transparent as possible about the information we do collect.

This privacy statement only applies to the website [countdown.zone](https://countdown.zone) and not to any other sites or software.

In this document, our definition of "personal information" refers to "personally identifiable information" as defined as follows in [California Internet Privacy Requirements [22577]](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&sectionNum=22577.):
> (a) The term “personally identifiable information” means individually identifiable information about an individual consumer collected online by the operator from that individual and maintained by the operator in an accessible form, including any of the following:
 (1) A first and last name.
 (2) A home or other physical address, including street name and name of a city or town.
 (3) An e-mail address.
 (4) A telephone number.
 (5) A social security number.
 (6) Any other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual.
 (7) Information concerning a user that the Web site or online service collects online from the user and maintains in personally identifiable form in combination with an identifier described in this subdivision.

## Data Retention

## Data Security
Since we do not collect personal information, there is no risk if it becomes public. We cannot contact individuals if there is unauthorized access to data because we do not collect any personal contact information.

## Removal of Data
Since we do not collect personal information, it is impossible for us to know for certain which data to delete if a request for removal is received. Using your browser settings, you may clear all data we store on your device so future visits will not be correlated with past visits.
